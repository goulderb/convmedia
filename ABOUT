==== About Convmedia ====
Convmedia is a collection of Linux/UNIX shell scripts for handling many multimedia tasks,
which are written for the GNU BASH shell. They utilize mplayer/mencoder, taglib's tagreader &
tagwriter binaries, as well as gpac/mkvtoolnix/vorbis-tools/flac and others.

At the time of writing, the project includes the following scripts:
- bcddb: A CDDB client written in shell script, which can query, read and parse CDDB entries. It
	utilizes wget and standard UNIX tools.
- btagger: A Vorbis/FLAC/ID3/MP4 audio tagging script, capable of tagging and renaming audio files.
- burnaudiocd: An audio CD burning script, which utilizes wodim/cdrecord to burn audio CDs which can be
	based off any audio format which mplayer supports.
- convaudio[-mt]: An audio transcoding script, which preserves metatags when transcoding between formats.
	The -mt version is a multithreaded variant, which processes multiple files at a time to speed up conversion.
- convavs[-batch]: A video transcoding/encoding script, which utilizes avs2yuv and wine to encode AviSynth
	scripts into video files. The batch variant allows for the usage of special input files which allow for
	bulk processing of multiple AviSynth scripts.
- convcd: A secure audio ripping application, which rips at least twice in order to ensure that rips are consistent.
- convvideo: A video transcoding/encoding script, which utilizing mencoder and other tools to produce high-quality,
	encoded videos in either MPEG-4 ASP or H.264 format.

All of these applications are built upon the core functions, which are included in the includes/ directory.
These have the extension of ".shlib", to distinguish them from regular shell-script files. These are more akin
to headers or modules in other languages, as they contain shared functions.

These shlibs include:
- generic-functions: Includes common functions which almost every frontend uses.
- audio-functions: Includes all of the generic audio encoding, decoding and processing functions.
- cddb-functions: Includes all of the generic cddb querying, reading and parsing functions.
- container-functions: Includes all of the generic metatag handling and muxing functions.
- video-functions: Includes all of the generic video encoding and processing functions.

It is designed to be fairly modification-friendly, and those wishing to extend and modify it are encouraged too.
Currently, documentation is somewhat out-dated, and certain portions may be undocumented; however the code is fairly
clean and readable. Because of this, those looking to modify it are encouraged to hack first and document later.
It is distributed under a liberal BSD-style license, which allows for anyone to modify it so long as they maintain
the copyright notice in the COPYING file.
