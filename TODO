Todo-list for the future:

convvideo:
	Improvements to video preset/tunings (user-definable presets and tuning)

convcd:
	Auto-run bcddb with reasonable defaults, but inform the user that no attempts to do any corrections will be given
	and that they will have to use bcddb in order to modify the tagging information used by convcd.
